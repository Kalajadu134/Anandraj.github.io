    <h2> Food <h3>(Litti-chokha)</h3>
    </h2>
    Litti, along with chokha, is a complete meal originated from the Indian subcontinent; and popular in Indian states
    of
    Bihar, Jharkhand, parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh as well as Nepalese state of Madhesh. It is a dough ball made up of
    whole wheat flour and stuffed with sattu (roasted chickpea flour) mixed with herbs and spices and then roasted over
    coal or cow dung cakes or wood then it is tossed with lots of ghee. Although very often confused with the closely
    related baati, it is a completely different dish in terms of taste, texture and preparation. It may be eaten with
    yogurt, baigan bharta, alu bharta, and papad. The litti are traditionally baked over a cow-dung fire, but in the
    modern day a new fried version has been developed.

    Herbs and spices used to flavour the litti include onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds,
    nigella seeds and salt. Tasty pickles can also be used to add spice flavour. In western Bihar and eastern Uttar
    Pradesh litti is served with murgh korma (a creamy chicken curry) or chokha (a vegetable preparation of roasted and
    mashed eggplant, tomato, and potato).

    Plateau. Odisha lies on the Eastern Ghats and the Deccan Plateau. The region is bounded by Bhutan, Nepal and the
    state
    of Sikkim in the north, the states of Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on the west, the state of Andhra Pradesh in the
    south and the country of Bangladesh in the east. It is also bounded by the Bay of Bengal in the south-east. It is
    connected to the Seven Sister States of Northeast India by the narrow Siliguri Corridor in the north east of West
    Bengal.</p>
  <h2>Tourism</h2>
  <p>The ruling ground of many ancient empires, East India has a strong ethnic culture and religious roots. Comprising
    the
    easternmost cities namely Odisha, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand. It spans over a total area
    of
    about 418,323 Sq Km wherein the bulk of the region is either near the Bay of Bengal or on the Indo-Gangetic plains.

    Kolkata, known as the Cultural Capital of India, is the largest city of East Indian region. Located in the state of
    West Bengal, it boasts 19th-century architectural marvels such as Victoria Memorial and Howrah Bridge. The narrow
    alleyways and markets blend well with the ancient temples, science centers, and educational institutions giving
    Kolkata a metropolitan character. West Bengal is also famous for its beautiful hill stations - Darjeeling, Siliguri,

    <h3>
      (Vada-pav)
    </h3>
    Vada pav, alternatively spelt vada pao, wada pav, or wada pao, is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of
    Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half
    through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chilli pepper. Although it
    originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also
    called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.
  </p>
  <h3>Western-India</h3>
  <p>
    Western India is a loosely defined region of India consisting of its western part. The Ministry of Home Affairs in
    its
    Western Zonal Council Administrative division includes the states of Goa, Gujarat, and Maharashtra along with the
    Union territory of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli[1] while the Ministry of Culture and some historians
    also
    include the state of Rajasthan.[2][3] The Geological Survey of India includes Maharashtra but excludes Rajasthan[4]
    whereas Ministry of Minority Affairs includes Karnataka but excludes Rajasthan.[5]

    Madhya Pradesh is also often included[6][7][8] and Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and southern Punjab are sometimes
    included.[9] Western India may also refer to the western half of India, i.e. all the states west of Delhi and
    Chennai,
    thus also including Punjab, Kerala and surrounding states.[10] The region is highly industrialised, with a large
    urban
    population.[11] Roughly, western India is bounded by the Thar Desert in the north, the Vindhya Range in the east and
    north and the Arabian Sea in the west. A major portion of Western India shares the Thar Desert with North India and
    Pakistan and the Deccan Plateau with South and Central India.

    In ancient history, Western India was divided into three great states according to Hwen Thsang, namely Sindh (which
    comprised the whole valley of the Indus from the Punjab to the sea, including the Delta and the island of Kutch),
    Gurjara (which comprised Western Rajputana and the Indian Desert), and Balabhi (which comprised the peninsula of
    Gujarat, with a small portion of the adjacent coast).[12] Before the partition of India, the now-Pakistani
    territories
    of Sindh and Balochistan were also included in this region. In art history, the term normally covers just Gujarat
    and
    Rajasthan, which tend to move together in terms of style.

    <h2>food</h2> <h3>chole-bhture</h3>  
    Chole bhture (Hindi: छोले भटूरे) is a dish originated initially from eastern Uttar Pradesh in the northern part of
    the
    Indian Subcontinent. Now this dish is famous invariably in north while having huge following in Punjab. It is a
    combination of chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura, a fried bread made from maida.

    Chhole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. However, it can also be a
    street
    food or a complete meal and may be accompanied by, for example, onions, carrot pickle, green chutney and achaar
  <h2>culture</h2>
  The term North Indian Culture officially describes the cultural heritage of the seven North Indian states of Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Chandigarh (Union Territory), Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh (which itself means "Northern State").[1] Other states which are not formally part of North India, but which are traditionally — culturally and linguistically — seen to be so are Rajasthan and Bihar. North Indian culture reflects the diversity of traditions and customs of the vast region it encompasses. North Indian Culture is mainly in Indo-Aryan traditions and customs, with the assimilation of — and impact from — other cultures over long periods of history. North Indian culture reflects the diversity of traditions and customs of the vast region it encompasses. Women traditionally wear salwar kameez, gagra choli, sari and phiran. Dupatta is worn to complete the outfit. Men traditionally wear kurta, achkan, kameez and sherwani for upper garment, lower garment includes dhoti, churidar, shalwar and Lungi. Pagri is usually worn around the head to complete the outfit, especially in rural areas. In the states of Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana and Gujarat, traditional dress is Kameez Shalwar. In the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and southern Haryana and Gujarat, it is ghagra choli. Pagri is worn in various region styles and is the symbol which shows one's status and the respect in which one is held. In urban centres and as well as rural areas western influence can easily be seen nowadays. Hindustani classical music or Shastriya Sangeet is the classical music of North India. It is a tradition that originated in Vedic ritual chants and has been evolving since the 12th century. Around the 12th century, Hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as Carnatic classical music. The central notion in both these systems is that of a melodic mode or raga, sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala. The tradition dates back to the ancient Samaveda, (lit. sāma=ritual chant), which deals with the norms for chanting of srutis or hymns such as the Rig Veda. These principles were refined in the Natyashastra by Bharata (2nd-3rd century AD) and the Dattilam (probably 3rd-4th century)).[2] Indian classical music has seven basic notes, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni, with five interspersed half-notes, resulting in a 12-note scale. The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called Taal. The melodic foundations are called ragas. Noted representatives of Shastriya Sangeet with a worldwide acclaim are Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.

The rich cultural diversity of North India is most clearly shown by the many different folk dance styles found here. Starting with Bhangra (men’s dance) and Giddha (women’s dance) from Punjab to Kathak in Uttar Pradesh; from Ghoomar and Kalbeliya dance from Rajasthan to Nati from Himachal Pradesh; Karma from Jharkhand to Panthi from Chhattisgarh; from Jagars and Pandva Nritya from Uttarakhand to Rouf of Kashmir celebrates the richness of culture and traditions of North India. Kud dance of Jammu & Kashmir is the way to thank local deities in the night of rainy season with the beats of drum like instrument Narsingha. Kathak is one of the eight classical dance forms as conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi. This dance form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathaks, or storytellers. Some believe it evolved from Lord Krishna's raas lilas, forms of which have also evolved into the popular Garba-style dances popular in other parts of region and Gujarat.Raas lilas portrays the love stories of lord Krishna. A dance form which depicts the eternal love. It was quintessential theatre, using instrumental and vocal music along with stylized gestures, to enliven the stories. The splendor and vastness of the architectural heritage of North India can easily be demonstrated by the fact that out of twenty-three cultural world heritage sites in India which have been declared by UNESCO, ten are in North India.[3] The Taj Mahal, a perfect blend of Muslim and Indian architecture, is one of the new seven wonders of the world. The Mahabodhi Temple complex at Bodh Gaya, Bihar built by Emperor Ashoka in 260 BC, marks the enlightenment of Siddhartha Gautam Buddha. Khajuraho temple and Buddhist monuments of Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh finds itself in the list of world heritage sites. Other renowned architectural and holy sites are Sri Harmandir Sahib ("The Golden Temple") in Amritsar, Punjab, Urban and Architectural Work of Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, Dilwara Temples of Mount Abu, Rajasthan to name only a few. A different genre of paintings evolved in North India especially the miniature paintings. Rajput Painting a style of Indian painting that evolved and flourished during the 18th century, in the royal courts of Rajputana. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans.

    <h1>food</h1><h3>(Dosa)</h3>
    A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter. It is
    somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram ground together in a fine,
    smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but
    the
    dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar and
    chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.
  </p>
  <h3>Culture</h3>
  <p>South Indian culture refers to the culture of the South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. South Indian culture though with its visible differences forms an important part of the Indian culture. The South Indian Culture is essentially the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body and femininity. It is exemplified through its dance, clothing, and sculptures.</p>
  <h3>Dance</h3>
  <p>The South Indian culture is celebrated in the elaborate dance forms of South India: Koodiyattam, Bharatanatyam, Oyilattam, Karakattam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Thirayattam,[27] Theyyam, Bhuta Kola, Ottamthullal, Oppana, Kerala Natanam, Mohiniaattam and Yakshagana. Thirayattam is a Ritualistic Performing art of South Malabar region in Kerala state.[28] The Bharatanatyam is the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body.[1][2][3][4][5] This is done through its tenets of having a perfectly erect posture, a straight and pout curving stomach, a well rounded and proportionate body mass to the body structure, very long hair and curvaceous hips.[1][2][4] These tenets bring to life the philosophy of Natyashastra, ‘Angikam bhuvanam yasya’ (The body is your world).[1][2][4] This is elaborated in the araimandi posture, wherein the performer assumes a half sitting position with the knees turned sideways, with a very erect posture. In this fundamental posture of the Bharatanatyam dance, the distance between the head and the navel becomes equal to that between the earth and the navel. In a similar way the distance between the outstretched right arm to the outstretched left arm becomes equal to the distance between the head and the feet, thus representing the "Natyapurusha", the embodiment of life and creation.</p>
